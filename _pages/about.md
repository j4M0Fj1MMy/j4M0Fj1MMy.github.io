I am working as a research assistant working under the <b>Prism Research Group</b> in HKUST. Our main research focus is program analysis, which aims to improve program security with both static and dynamic analysis techniques. I have worked on a <b>decompiler</b>, a type inference model, and IoT firmware fuzzing framework.

In college , I have been an core member of the <b>HKUST Firebird</b> CTF Team, a Hong Kong Top 2 academic competitive Cybersecurity team. I explored ethical hacking by joining competition. 

I took 2 internships, including a data engineer role in the <b><a href="https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/about/sustainability-team">HKUST sustainability department</a></b>, and a full-stack developer role in a start-up <a href="https://www.performve.com/">PerformVE</a>.

I am still exploring what suit me the best. Therefore, I took the chance to study and experience the knowledge in many different fields, including the area in cybersecurity, machine learning, data analyitcs, web development, Maths.
