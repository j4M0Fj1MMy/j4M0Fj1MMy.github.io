Hi there! This is a little place of Jimmy. I love to write about my `life`, `experience`, `philosophy`, my everything! Be sure to check them out if you want to know more about me!

I worked as a research assistant under the `Cybersecurity Lab` at HKUST. Our main research focus is program analysis, which aims to improve program security with both static and dynamic analysis techniques. I have worked on a decompiler, a type inference model, and an IoT firmware fuzzing framework.

In college, I was a core member of the `HKUST Firebird` CTF Team, which was ranked as one of the top 2 academic competitive Cybersecurity teams in Hong Kong. I explored ethical hacking through participation in weekly training sections and various competitions.

I have completed two internships. The first was a data engineer role in the [`HKUST Sustainability Department`](https://sust.hkust.edu.hk/about/sustainability-team), where I focused on data management and analysis for sustainability initiatives. The second internship was as a full-stack developer in a startup called [`PerformVE`](https://www.performve.com/), where I gained experience in web development.

I am still exploring different fields to determine my best fit. As a result, I have taken the opportunity to study and gain experience in various areas, including `cybersecurity`, `machine learning`, `data analytics`, `web development`, and `mathematics`.
