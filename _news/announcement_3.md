## Why I Moved

> Due to various reasons, I made the decision to leave my home country and seek independence. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and explore life beyond the familiar. When the opportunity arose to move to another country, I saw it as a chance to gain experiences that may not be easily attainable later in life. Being young, I felt I had everything to gain and nothing to lose!

## Canada: My Chosen Destination

> Canada, known for its cold climate, became my chosen destination. I have always been drawn to colder regions, and Canada's weather aligns with my preferences. Additionally, I have a fondness for maple and cherry blossom, which are synonymous with the country. Considering my interest lies in the IT field, Canada stood out as one of the best places to build a successful IT career.
