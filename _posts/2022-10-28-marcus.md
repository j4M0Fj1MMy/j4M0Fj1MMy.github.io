<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mleungshea/">Marcus LEUNG-SHEA</a> is the mentor of my data engineer internship. He is a caring, smart, resonsive, and responsible person. I am grateful that he was one of my supervisor in my life.

In his back, not only did I learn stuff about data analysis techniques, but I also learnt how to be confident, what is leadership, how to effectively communicate, and how to be a caring person.  

Even after my intership ends, we are still very good friends. Before I left Hong Kong. We had an epic hot pot dinner at his place, with my intern buddy Venus. It was one of the best dinner I have ever had. That is the first time I realize how good working with good people can be. In the future, I hope that I will see more mentor like him!
