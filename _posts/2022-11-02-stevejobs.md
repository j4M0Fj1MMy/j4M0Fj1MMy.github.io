## Thinking about dying tmr, will the thing you are doing right now makes you regret?

Of course, if I think about dying tomorrow, the things I am doing right now would definitely make me regret. Most of the things I can do at this moment are focused on securing my future. I wouldn't be able to live if I didn't.

Steve Jobs was successful and rich at the moment he thought about this topic. His investment of time when he was young yield this result. Therefore, he has the means to do whatever he wants. Yet, his words are still inspiring.

## I would understand it as: we are on the road of death, did you treasure yesterdaty, today, and how about tomorrow?

What is a good day, and what is a bad day? Is the good really good?

There are times when, even after 20 years, you can still describe exactly what happened. There are also times when, after just one week, you probably won't remember what you did. I can still vividly recall the excitement I felt when I first traveled to Japan with my friend Bill. Everything was so fresh; taking the train was fun, eating in a Japanese restaurant was amazing, and walking through the streets was refreshing. I had never experienced this feeling before. In that moment, I truly understood what it means to be happy in your soul. Such experiences are usually the new experience, but just new is not enough; it must also be something I truly desire. It's like the feeling of dreams coming true, and I will never forget it for my entire life.

For a good day, you must be able to discern how good it is. Even for a bad day, you can gauge its level of unpleasantness. What you cannot discern is the day that you have forgotten. Therefore, to have many good days, you need to remember a lot of days.

Collectively, good days make up a good lifeâ€”a life in which you can share with others the excitement, touching moments, and resilience you've experienced. Therefore, let's not settle for an okay life; instead, let's strive for a good life.

Exploring new and exciting things, cherishing precious moments, and being able to remember the smallest joys in life are the ingredients for a good life. By constantly seeking out new experiences, embracing the memorable moments, and holding onto the excitement they bring, we can create a life that is fulfilling and meaningful. It is through these endeavors that we discover what truly brings us happiness and fulfillment. So, let's continue to explore, cherish, and remember the joys that life offers, as they are the building blocks of a truly good life.
