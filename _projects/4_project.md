**Development Stack:** Flask, RESTful API, GCP 

**Objective:** The objective of this website is to save your time from learning and writing scripts for querying the API of HKUST. It is hassle-free, I gaurantee.

Before data analytics, one must first get the data. However, what if the API does not provide documentation? Then you will need to recon, trail and error, which cost a lot of time. Writing the scripts that query the data over a time period can be tricky. but the data analysis interns only have very limited time. If all of them need to figure it out again and again, it will be a total waste of time and at the time they figured everything out, they internship is already close to the end. This project aims to skip the aforementioned process and let the analysts do their job right at the beginning.

Just provide your interested parameters, and get most things you want already! Althouh I cannot give you the website due to the close-sourced data, I can show you some pictures of the flow!

**Flow:**
First, select the branch you want to work with.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/api_demo/1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    I chose the branch "sensor-data"
</div>

Then, the parameters will be rendered, you have to choose the locations, and query parameters.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/api_demo/2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can type and search!
</div>

Next, choose the time frame of interest.
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/api_demo/3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Let's try 1 March to 27 March
</div>

Done! You get your data, so damn easy!
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/api_demo/4.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
