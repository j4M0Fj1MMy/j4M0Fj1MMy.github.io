Setting up the pipeline that ouput the data over a time period can be tricky. While all data analysis interns only have limited time. If all of them need to figure it out again and again, it will be a total waste of time and at the time they figured everything out, they job period is already close to the end. Therefore, this project aims to skip the aforementioned process and let analysts do their job right at the beginning.

By providing simple command, you can get your desired data easily! The project is only for HKUST internal use. This is beacuse the data is not opened and it requires a key. But you are welcome to have a look <a href=https://github.com/j4M0Fj1MMy/UstApiHelper>here</a>
